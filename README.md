# 🛤️ RailRoad 🚂

Just a simple simulation of a railroad with trains moving along the path.

In general, it was started as a test of the CSS animation on the SVG path. 
And since I had a lot of fun with it, I decided to make it a little more complex.
As long as you want to have more control over the animations (speed, direction, switchers), JavaScript (TypeScript) is the way to go.
